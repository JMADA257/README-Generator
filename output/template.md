## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
My motivation for this project was to create a way I could generate readme's without having to do them myself! I built this project to help me build README's which sometimes can be a painful last task to do! This did exactly that for me! I learned more about require OOP and the fact that I can use functions and classes from other JS pages!
